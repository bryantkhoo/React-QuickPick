# React QuickPick

Always wanted to try building my own boilerplate without using CRA! This is a personal boilerplate adapted from:

 [How to build your own React Boilerplate](https://medium.com/@sethalexander/how-to-build-your-own-react-boilerplate-1a97d09337fd)

## Getting Started

### Instructions

```

### Running the boilerplate
